# News-Summarizer-Ai
Instead of going to news sites and reading the news one by one, I made an artificial intelligence-supported project that summarizes the breaking news and if we are interested we can enter the link and we can read in detail.
What was done in project:
-Used web scraping techniques with the 'BeautifulSoup' library to extract breaking news from one of the most popular news sites.
-Used Gemini API, Google's Artificial Intelligence, to summarize news articles as succinctly as possible.
-You can edit your summary type as you wish in the prompt section of the code. I wanted to summarize each news in 3 lines of text
-Additionally, added a voice reading feature to enable auditory playback of the summarized news articles.
I added the text-to-speech feature for the visually impaired. They can follow the news faster and more efficiently.
Also people can quickly catch up on the news while doing business at the same time.
